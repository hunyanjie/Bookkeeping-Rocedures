## Note
1: remember to choose a **suitable for this program** bill storage file to achieve the previous bill content reading.

3: if you are not sure you can create a blank file for bill reading and writing.

4: all the current file encoding format is "UTF-8" and can be read and written, otherwise the program may not be able to save your modifications or even crash!

- Added custom profile support in a future version (update time not announced) to support custom file encoding, custom default selection file, custom more language support, custom drop-down list content, etc.
